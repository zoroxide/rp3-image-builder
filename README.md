# How to run?
- for raspberry pi 3, run : ```sudo bash build-rp3-image.sh```
- for normal x86 machines, run this: ```sudo bash minimal-x86-image.sh```
- then watch the cocking!
# Can you add more platforms?
- this repo might be useless because there are already complete full tools for this like yocto or buildroot. Still, only the kernel master knows that there are times you need to build the kernel by yourself so this will enhance some time of yours instead of typing boilerplate commands, please contribute with your build script!
# TODO
- [ ] code a builder script for beaglebone boards
